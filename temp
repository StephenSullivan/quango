Because I don't like typing lots of things into shell I use a number of simple scripts to automate tasks, this one starts MongoDB it is about as simple as it gets. Note that I usually run my processes in screen sessions so I can re-attach them easily, mainly useful when developing, but then hey, thats what I do :)

The script:

    #!/bin/sh
    #
    # Script to start MongoDB
    # 
    SCREEN_BIN="/usr/bin/screen" #your path to screen 
    MONGOD_BIN="~/mongodb/bin/mongod"
    $SCREEN_BIN -S MONGO -d -m MONGOD_BIN
    echo "MongoDB started on MONGO screen"
    echo "screen -r MONGO to re-attach"
    echo "When in screen 'ctrl+a+d' to detach again"


Notes:

Save your script as "db-start.sh" or something then you just type "./db-start.sh" to kick it off. Once you have the hang of *starting* the database, you may also be interested in the backup and restore scripts. You may need to  "chmod 700 db-start.sh" to make it executable









#!/bin/sh
#
# Script to start MongoDB
# 

SCREEN="/usr/bin/screen" #your path to screen
MONGOD="~/mongodb/bin/mongod" #your path to mongod ( may be different )

$SCREEN -S MONGO -d -m echo "Sausage"
#$SCREEN -r MONGO echo "sausage"

#sudo ~/mongodb/bin/mongod

#$SCREEN -d MONGO

$SCREEN -ls

echo "MongoDB started on MONGO screen"
echo "screen -r MONGO to re-attach"
echo "When in screen 'ctrl+a+d' to detach again"
