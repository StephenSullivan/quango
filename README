Quango is a fork of the Shapado project ( http://github.com/ricodigo/shapado )

Shapado is a great project and if you are specifically looking for a knowledge exchange Q&A site then that is a great choice for you - additionally it has been updated to support Rails 3.0 . The main differences between Shapado and Quango are as follows:

* Quango supports multiple content types, not just questions - for example news, articles, links, videos etc
* Quango supports images and image uploading via the very excellent dragonfly
* Quango pulls video information straight from YouTube using Nokogiri
* Quango pulls information from links


In essence Quango is similar to a multi-user blog, however with Quango any member of the site can post we call this approach Social Publishing.

Coming Soon

* Quango introduces the concept of GroupConnect, which allows seperate groups to share content where relevant
