This release has some major changes and modifications - we have tried to simplify the format of the header and major improvements to the member profiles. The less complex header is designed to make the end user experience more straightforward as before we had mutiple levels of navigation. Channel tabs are still available however these will be deprecated by the drop down in the toolbar
