This is mainly a bugfix release, but also a few usability issues

Changelog


* Fixed the listing order for summaries and listings - still not sorting correclty, but a step in the right direction
* Added "channels" bar between header and contextual navigation - it's off by default - at present it allows you to put an additional hardcoded block of navigation in ( use the channel_listing_horizontal class in css )
* Added the "bump" feature, admins and authors can "bump" a post back up the list ( will restrict this to 3 bumps eventually )
* Made the images process much more obvious
* Added an "actions' widet on index and show pages - not sure how much simpler I can make that
* Made default state of section headers closed
* Section header state editable by admin
* Added the homepage section which shows the three main sections in summary form
