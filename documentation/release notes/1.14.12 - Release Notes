This is mainly a bugfix release, but also a few usability issues

Changelog


* Fixed the listing order for summaries and listings - still not sorting correclty, but a step in the right direction
* Added "channels" bar between header and contextual navigation - it's off by default - at present it allows you to put an additional hardcoded block of navigation in ( use the channel_listing_horizontal class in css )
* Added the "bump" feature, admins and authors can "bump" a post back up the list ( will restrict this to 3 bumps eventually )
* Made the images process much more obvious
* Added an "actions' widet on index and show pages - not sure how much simpler I can make that
* Made default state of section headers closed
* Section header state editable by admin
* Added the homepage section ( default closed for now ) This will be the community magazine type thing 



Bugfixes ( Spotted by )



Stylefixes

* Made the "Edit text" and "add images buttons" red and green and much more obvious than before
* Change the icons to text for watch and book mark and made easier to see button


Developers Notes

* Stripped out the cookies thing - who cares is the browser remembers if a section header is open or closed?


Pending for next release:

* Need to figure out why the images do not work correctly in production mode, but work perfectly in dev mode
* Rollovers for member lists ( mono -> colour )
* Fix bumping to be a maximum of three times
* Adapt bump into pin so posts can be made sticky as well as bumped
* Fixed admin area so admins can manage members ( eg. assign owners to communities )
* Added a "Ladning page" - non-logged guests instead of first seeing the homepage, they get a landing page which explains exactly what the site is and how it works. To date people don't realize that *anybody* can add an article or thought or link to a site. [I think many people still don't get this about Wikipedia either]. JK never tires of pointing out to me that not everybody is a naturally wired in to this kind of stuff as I am
