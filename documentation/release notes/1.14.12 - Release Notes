This is mainly a bugfix release, but also a few usability issues

Changelog


* Made the "Edit text" and "add images buttons" red and green and much more obvious than before
* Change the icons to text for watch and book mark and made easier to see button
* Improved support for logo in the toolbar for the community sponsor - currently the old shapado blob way

* Made the images process much more obvious & removed the polaroid icon from the markdown editor

* Added an "actions' widet on index and show pages - not sure how much simpler I can make that
* Made default state of section headers closed
* Stripped out the cookies thing - who cares is the browser remembers if a section header is open or closed?
* Section header state editable by admin
* Added the homepage section ( default closed for now ) This will be the community magazine type thing

Developers Notes

Pending for next release:

* Rollovers for member lists ( mono -> colour )

* Fixed admin area so admins can manage members ( eg. assign owners to communities )
* Added a "Ladning page" - non-logged guests instead of first seeing the homepage, they get a landing page which explains exactly what the site is and how it works. To date people don't realize that *anybody* can add an article or thought or link to a site. [I think many people still don't get this about Wikipedia either]. JK never tires of pointing out to me that not everybody is a naturally wired in to this kind of stuff as I am
