This is mainly a bugfix release, but also a few usability issues

Changelog

* Removed the dummy image placeholders and replaced with a text box - better not to rely on any third party site wherever possible and keep think entirely self-contained other than the linkouts to FB and Linked etc
* Removed the summary lists for the homepage items already open to make homepage more cleaner
* Added "new""hot" and "edited" markers in the new homepage lists 
* Switched order of signup on content pages
* Straightened out the bug thingy at the bottom & moved from thoughtdomains to think
* Moved channels from general to it's own tab under admin


Bugfixes ( Spotted by )

* Show today/Hide today fixed for Hot homepage
* Bump button?

Stylefixes

* Standardized the content lists with one pixel whitespace above image
* Twiddled a bit with the logo-text, typically I expect these will be overwritten by logo's anyway
* Made the inline comments wider - I still think answers and inline comments are a bit confusing though



Developers Notes


Pending for next release:


* Need to figure out why the images do not work correctly in production mode, but work perfectly in dev mode
* Rollovers for member lists ( mono -> colour )
* Fix bumping to be a maximum of three times & fix the "bumped by" on show pages - consider a bumpk marker?
* Adapt bump into pin so posts can be made sticky as well as bumped
* Fixed admin area so admins can manage members ( eg. assign owners to communities )


      %div{:style=>"margin:0 0 8px 0:display:hidden"}
        - @avatar = Avatar.find(current_user.default_avatar)
        - if @avatar.present?
          - cropped_avatar = @avatar.avatar.process(:thumb,@avatar.avatar_cropping)
          - default_avatar = cropped_avatar.process(:thumb,"32x32").url
          = image_tag default_avatar, :style => "margin-bottom:-4px"
        - else
          = image_tag "/images/anonymous_avatar.png", :height => "32px", :width => "32px"
