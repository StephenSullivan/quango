This is a major release so we have updated now to the 1.15.x series - there have been many many changes and improvements to the system in this release

Changelog

* Added the black toolbar at the top - this has yoyo-ed a bit over the project but following various discussions with clients it has become clear that we need to provide maximum screen real estate for the client ( TD is after all simply a service provider )
** Toolbar - now features dropdown on left, when a member is logged in the groups they have participated in appear here
** Toolbar - added the "Submissions" button so members can reach the various posting options direct from the toolbar


* posting process improved - video's and links now much more automated - when you post a video it grabs the info direct from youtube. Links currently grab *some* of the info from the target page however this will be greatly improved in the next release with the addition of the ALchemy API - ( NLP/Text mining) Note ths functionality is also necessary later for the inbound feeds - When working properly these are in fact KILLER FEATURES
