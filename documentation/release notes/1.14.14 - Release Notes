Changelog

* Fixed the page titles they now read a sane " Page title | Group Name | Legend " on all pages
* Group naming for communities that do not use a custom logo - display name is now distinct from group name
* Group name itself must be unique - eg "marketing-australia" and "marketing-uk" however bot groups can display the same namein the toolbar - this solves the problem of having multiple identically named domains across different TLDs 
* Added the optional "Sponsored links" section - this delivers a standardized approach to handling multiple site sponsors, usually used for paid sponsorship slots
* Added optional leaderboard & medium slot for homepage, index and show pages. Place script here from a 3rd party ad server - this is the simplest and most efficient approach however maybe later we will support native banners for "completeness"
* In list blocks you can now click anywhere - not just the link itself - this is mainly a usability thing
* Made the signup button glow pleasantly after a short while
* Tidied up admin a bit
* Various image uploader issues
