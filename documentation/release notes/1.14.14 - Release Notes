This is mainly a bugfix release, but also a few usability issues

Changelog

* Added the optional "Sponsored links" section - this delivers a standardized approach to handling multiple site sponsors, usually used for paid sponsorship slots

* Added optional leaderboard & medium slot for homepage and index pages. Medium Rectangle/Half Page slots only on show, cyrrently non-functional however these will eventually be populated from a 3rd party ad server - this is the simplest and most efficient approach howver maybe later we will support native banners for "completeness"
* In list blocks you can now click anywhere - not just the link itself - this is mainly a usability thing
