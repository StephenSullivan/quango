This is mainly a bugfix release, but also a few usability issues

Changelog

* Improved support for logo in the toolbar for the community sponsor - hardwired atm
* made "about label" editable ( appears for non-logged in users in toolbar and in the description box on homepage )
* Switched order of sponsor block to bottom and description to top
* Made the sponsor logo and text independent ( means you can show neither, either or both ) This is primarily useful if there are multiple sponsors and they be different sponsor types 
* Commented out "My Edition" and "My Community" until those sections are ready
* Removed "Related Communities" for Isolated Comms
* Fixed the flubble notice
* Added variations of grey as a conviguration option
* Simplified the main create form
* Simplified the member setting section
* Improved the UI on profile images


Stylefixes

* Made the tags simpler and more obvious
* Fixed various buttons that weren't appearing in IE
* Added variations of grey as a conviguration option
* Sorted out the block headers in the member profile and settings pages


Developers Notes:

Pending for next release:

* Fixed admin area so admins can manage members ( eg. assign owners to communities )
* Rollovers for member lists ( mono -> colour )
